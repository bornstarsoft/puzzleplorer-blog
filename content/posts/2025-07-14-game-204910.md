Sovietborgs is set to redefine the retro gaming landscape with its unique blend of top-down run'n gun action and an alternate history narrative. Developed by @RetroSumus, the game invites players to control a squad of three Sovietborgs in a world dominated by the Soviet Empire, where they must combat monsters and rebel factions. This intriguing premise, combined with its crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, has already captured the attention of gaming enthusiasts worldwide.

With its stunning pre-rendered graphics reminiscent of classics like Donkey Kong Country and an engaging soundtrack inspired by iconic series such as Red Alert, Sovietborgs promises to deliver a nostalgic yet fresh gaming experience. As the game aims to support classic platforms like the Sega Genesis and Dreamcast, it appeals not only to new players but also to those who cherish the golden age of gaming.

As we await the outcome of the crowdfunding campaign, one can't help but wonder: will Sovietborgs succeed in bringing back the charm of retro gaming while offering a compelling narrative? The gaming community is certainly eager to find out!
