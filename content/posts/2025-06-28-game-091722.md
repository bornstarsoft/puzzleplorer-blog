The gaming community is buzzing with excitement following the leak of 15 minutes of gameplay from EA's upcoming Battlefield title, showcasing the classic Rush mode. This mode, which pits attackers against defenders in a high-stakes battle to destroy objectives, has been a fan favorite across multiple Battlefield games. With the game currently in closed testing, the leaked footage offers a tantalizing glimpse into what players can expect when the game officially launches.

Electronic Arts has confirmed that the next Battlefield game will be released by March 2026, with a full public reveal set for this summer. This time around, EA is adopting a more transparent development approach, likely in response to the community's disappointment with Battlefield 2042. With four internal studios collaborating under the Battlefield Studios banner, the new game aims to create a connected universe set in modern times, which could redefine the franchise.

As we await more details and the official reveal, the excitement around the Rush mode and the overall direction of the Battlefield series is palpable. Will this new installment live up to the legacy of its predecessors? Only time will tell.
