Ubisoft recently faced tough questions regarding its commitment to game preservation during a shareholder meeting, particularly in light of the Stop Killing Games petition. This movement, which has garnered nearly 1.4 million signatures, seeks to regulate the gaming industry to prevent publishers from rendering purchased games inaccessible after support has ended. The petition was partly fueled by the backlash following the shutdown of Ubisoft's game, The Crew, which highlighted the fragility of digital game ownership.

CEO Yves Guillemot acknowledged the challenges of maintaining accessibility in a market where service support is finite. He emphasized that while Ubisoft strives to keep games playable, the reality is that all publishers face similar dilemmas. As technology evolves, older games may become obsolete, necessitating new versions and updates. Guillemot's remarks underscore a broader industry issue: how to balance consumer expectations with the practical limitations of game support.

As the conversation around game preservation intensifies, it raises important questions about the future of digital ownership and the responsibilities of publishers. Will the industry adapt to meet the demands of gamers, or will the challenge of maintaining access to beloved titles continue to grow?
