It seems that Marvels Wolverine, one of the most anticipated titles for PlayStation in 2026, will not be part of this weeks State of Play presentation. Despite the excitement surrounding the game, Insomniac Games has hinted that fans will have to wait until Spring 2026 for more information. This news comes as a disappointment to many who were hoping for updates or even a potential release date during the showcase.

Sonys State of Play is set to take place on February 12, featuring over 60 minutes of news and gameplay updates from various studios. While many assumed Wolverine would be included, Insomniac's response on social media suggests they are managing expectations ahead of the event. This strategic communication may help mitigate fan disappointment if the game is absent from the lineup.

As we look forward to the State of Play, it raises the question: what other surprises does Sony have in store? With a plethora of titles in development, fans are eager to see what the future holds for PlayStation.
