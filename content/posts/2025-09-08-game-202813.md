In a landmark case, Nintendo has successfully secured a $2 million settlement against Ryan Daly, a modchip seller who previously denied any wrongdoing. This case highlights the ongoing battle between gaming companies and those who facilitate the use of unauthorized hardware, particularly in the realm of modded consoles. Daly, who operated Modded Hardware, was accused of selling modded Switch consoles that enabled the play of pirated games, a serious infringement on Nintendo's intellectual property rights.

The lawsuit, initiated in July 2024, revealed that Daly had initially agreed to cease his sales of modded devices but continued to do so, claiming he was seeking legal counsel. Nintendo's complaint outlined multiple charges, including copyright infringement and trafficking in circumvention devices. Ultimately, rather than face a lengthy court battle, Daly opted for a settlement, which includes a permanent injunction preventing him from dealing with modded hardware in the future.

This case serves as a stark reminder of the legal ramifications that can arise from the sale of modded gaming hardware. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the enforcement of copyright laws will likely remain a hot topic. Will we see more companies taking similar actions to protect their intellectual property?
