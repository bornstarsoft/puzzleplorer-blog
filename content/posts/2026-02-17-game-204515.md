In a recent interview, Naoki Hamaguchi, the director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, addressed concerns regarding the quality of the upcoming third installment being developed for multiple platforms. He emphasized that the decision to make Part 3 a multiplatform release, including Xbox Series S and Switch 2, will not compromise the game's quality. Hamaguchi stated, "Our development structure simply doesnt work that way to begin with I suppose Ill just have to keep saying it."

Hamaguchi elaborated on the technical aspects of the development process, explaining how the team optimizes the game for each platform individually. He noted that the game is designed with high-end PCs as the lead platform, allowing them to scale down for lower-spec systems without sacrificing overall quality. This approach ensures that players on all platforms will enjoy a rich gaming experience, regardless of hardware limitations.

As the gaming community eagerly awaits the release, it raises an interesting question: how will the advancements in technology continue to shape the future of game development? With directors like Hamaguchi at the helm, it seems the future is bright for multiplatform gaming.
