Gentoo Rescue is not just another puzzle game; it's a cerebral challenge that will push your problem-solving skills to the limit. With its charming visuals and deceptively simple mechanics, this game from Jagriff invites players into an open world filled with nested puzzles that blend metroidvania elements with innovative gameplay twists.
