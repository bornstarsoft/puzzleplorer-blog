In a remarkable turn of events, an Eastern Shore man who rarely plays the lottery decided to try his luck with a $5 Gold Bar Bingo scratch-off ticket, ultimately winning a staggering $50,000. This unexpected windfall serves as a reminder that sometimes, taking a chance can lead to life-changing rewards.

The lucky winner purchased his ticket at a 7-Eleven in Easton and discovered his fortune at home, revealing four corners on the sixth card of the game. His excitement was palpable as he shared the news with his family and girlfriend, marking a significant moment in his life. With plans to save the money, he continues to work as an HVAC technician while also cutting hair on the side.

This win not only benefits the winner but also the 7-Eleven store, which receives a $500 bonus for selling the top-tier scratch-off. As the Gold Bar Bingo game continues, four $50,000 prizes remain unclaimed, leaving many hopeful for their own lucky break. Will you be the next to try your luck?
