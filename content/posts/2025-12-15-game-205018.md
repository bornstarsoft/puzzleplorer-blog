Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, initially developed in 1991 by Chris Oberth, is making a comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, not only revives a piece of gaming history but also includes a detailed manual that chronicles the game's troubled past and Oberth's career. The initiative highlights the ongoing challenges of preserving 8-bit history while supporting the archival efforts of the VGHF.

As we see the revival of Xcavator, it raises important questions about the preservation of video game history and the stories behind the games we love. How many more hidden gems are waiting to be rediscovered?
