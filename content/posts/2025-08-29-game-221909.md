Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is gearing up for its much-anticipated annual Summit, set to take place on September 24, 2025, just ahead of the Tokyo Game Show. This event promises to unveil exciting new developments, including the next installment in the beloved Like A Dragon series. With last year's Summit revealing the intriguing Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza, expectations are high for what this year's event will bring.

In addition to the new Like A Dragon title, fans are eager to learn more about Stranger Than Heaven, a project shrouded in mystery since its initial announcement. Set in Japan in 1915, the game's connection to the Yakuza universe remains unclear, leaving fans speculating about its potential impact on the franchise. Furthermore, the studio is also reportedly working on the next Virtua Fighter game, adding to the excitement surrounding their upcoming announcements.

As the gaming community eagerly awaits the Summit, the question on everyone's mind is: what surprises does Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have in store for us this year? The anticipation is palpable, and we can only hope for thrilling revelations that will elevate the gaming experience for fans worldwide.
