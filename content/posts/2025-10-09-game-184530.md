October is shaping up to be an exciting month for Xbox Game Pass subscribers, with the highly anticipated Ninja Gaiden 4 leading the charge. Alongside this, players can look forward to the remastered Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and DoubleFines latest title, Keeper. These additions are sure to enhance the gaming experience for fans of action-packed adventures.

However, it's not all good news, as some titles will be leaving the service soon. Players should take note of Cocoon, Core Keeper, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, which will soon be unavailable on Cloud, Console, and PC. With the recent updates to Game Pass offerings and pricing, this month marks a significant shift in how Microsoft is curating its game library.

As we dive into October, it will be interesting to see how these changes affect player engagement and what new titles might be on the horizon. Are you excited about these upcoming games?
