In a significant move for the gaming community, Respawn has announced that the Nintendo Switch version of Apex Legends will be shutting down this summer. Starting August 4, 2026, players will no longer be able to enjoy the game on the Switch, marking the end of an era for those who have been part of the vibrant Nintendo community since the game's launch on the platform in 2021.

As players prepare for this transition, its crucial to note that while they can continue to earn rewards and play until the shutdown date, any Apex Coins accumulated on the Switch will not transfer to other platforms. To retain their currency, players will need to either spend it before the shutdown or upgrade to the upcoming Switch 2 version, which promises a better gaming experience.

This decision reflects a broader trend in the gaming industry, where developers are increasingly focusing on optimizing their games for newer hardware. As the gaming landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see how players adapt to these changes and what new opportunities the Switch 2 will bring for Apex Legends enthusiasts.
