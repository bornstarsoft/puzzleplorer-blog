In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has officially announced that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will be taken offline permanently on January 31, 2027. This decision follows the company's shift away from MMO development, marking a significant moment for the gaming community that has invested time and passion into this virtual world.

As of today, New World has been removed from all storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store. Players will still have access to the game they purchased, but they will no longer be able to buy in-game currency starting July 20, 2026. This news has left many fans reflecting on their experiences in Aeternum, as the game prepares for its final chapter.

Amazon Games expressed gratitude to the community, acknowledging the dedication and passion that players have shown throughout the game's lifecycle. They plan to extend the Nighthaven season until the servers shut down, ensuring that players have one last chance to enjoy the adventure together. As we approach this bittersweet farewell, one can't help but wonder what the future holds for MMO enthusiasts and whether new titles will rise to fill the void left by New World.
