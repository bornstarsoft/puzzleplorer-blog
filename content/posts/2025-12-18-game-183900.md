In a shocking turn of events, hardware sales and physical game spending in the US have hit their lowest point in 30 years this past November. According to Circana, a market research firm, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, marking a significant drop from previous years. This decline is attributed to a combination of high average prices for new consoles and a general downturn in consumer spending during what is typically a peak shopping month due to Black Friday and holiday purchases.

The average price for a new gaming console reached an all-time high of $439, an 11% increase from last year, which likely deterred many potential buyers. The PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, followed closely by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S. Meanwhile, physical software sales also saw a steep decline, falling 14% compared to the previous year, indicating a broader shift towards digital gaming.

As the gaming industry grapples with these challenges, questions arise about the future of hardware pricing and consumer engagement. Will manufacturers find a way to lower prices, or are we witnessing a fundamental shift in how gamers purchase and interact with their favorite titles?
