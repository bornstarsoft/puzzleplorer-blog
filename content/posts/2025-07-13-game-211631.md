If youre a fan of indie horror games, now is the perfect time to grab a free copy of Haus Of Irndrous on Steam. Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric horror puzzle game is currently available at no cost until July 19, 2025. After this date, it will transition to a paid model, priced at just $1.99. This unique opportunity not only allows players to experience the chilling first chapter but also supports the ongoing development of future episodes, which are set to be released as paid content.

Originally launched in early access in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous has been designed as an episodic experience, with the first chapter intended to be free. However, the recent announcement from Yxtopia Studios indicates a strategic shift in their business model to help fund future developments and server support. This change reflects a growing trend in the gaming industry where developers seek sustainable funding models to enhance their projects.

As the game continues to evolve, players can expect improvements and new content, including enemy AI enhancements and performance optimizations introduced in the latest update. With the clock ticking down to the price change, will you take advantage of this limited-time offer? Don't miss out on the chance to explore the eerie world of Haus Of Irndrous before it becomes a paid title!
