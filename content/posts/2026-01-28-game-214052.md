In the ever-evolving landscape of console gaming, Call of Duty continues to hold its ground as the #2 most played game, just behind Fortnite. Despite the negative discourse surrounding it, recent data from Circana reveals that Call of Duty is thriving on consoles, while Battlefield 6 is struggling to maintain its player base. This stark contrast highlights the importance of consistent content updates and community engagement in keeping players invested.

While Battlefield 6 may have a more favorable reception on Steam, its performance on consoles is faltering, raising questions about EA's strategy moving forward. With the gaming community's expectations high, EA must deliver compelling content to revive interest in Battlefield 6. On the other hand, Call of Duty's recent seasonal updates and collaborations, such as the Marvel Rivals content drop, have proven effective in attracting players and maintaining engagement.

As we look ahead, the competition between these two franchises will undoubtedly shape the future of console gaming. Will Battlefield 6 rise to the challenge and reclaim its player base, or will Call of Duty continue to dominate the console landscape? Only time will tell.
