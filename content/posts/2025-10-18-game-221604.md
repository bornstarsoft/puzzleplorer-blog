Square Enix's recent video comparison of Final Fantasy 7 Remake across the Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC highlights an impressive feat: the Switch 2 version holds its ground visually against more powerful consoles. The footage showcases the opening sequence, revealing that while there are subtle differences in texture quality, the overall visual fidelity remains remarkably close across all platforms.

Interestingly, the video runs at 30 frames per second, which limits a direct comparison of frame rates. The PS5 and PC versions can achieve higher frame rates, but the Switch 2 is designed to maintain a stable 30fps without sacrificing crucial elements like lighting. Director Naoki Hamaguchi emphasized that maintaining high-quality lighting was essential to avoid making the game feel inferior, showcasing the team's commitment to delivering a solid port.

As we look forward to the January 22 release alongside the Xbox Series X/S version, it raises the question: can the Switch 2 continue to impress with its performance in future titles?
