The Legacy of Kain series is making a triumphant return with two highly anticipated titles: the remaster of Legacy of Kain: Defiance and a brand-new 2D action game, Legacy of Kain: Ascending. Scheduled for release on March 3 and March 31 respectively, these games promise to reignite the passion of long-time fans while attracting new players to this iconic dark fantasy saga.

Crystal Dynamics has put significant effort into the Defiance Remastered, enhancing visuals and gameplay while also including lost levels and concept art. This remaster not only serves as a nostalgic trip for veterans but also aims to provide a modern gaming experience that highlights the epic conclusion of Raziel and Kain's story. On the other hand, Ascending offers a fresh take with its retro-inspired gameplay, focusing on fluid combat and exploration in a beautifully crafted pixel art world.

As the Legacy of Kain series continues to thrive, one can't help but wonder: will these new releases spark a revival of interest in the franchise, paving the way for even more adventures in Nosgoth?
