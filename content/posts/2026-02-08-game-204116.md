If youre a fan of puzzle games but often find them too challenging, then Botany Manor might just be the perfect fit for you. Currently available for free on the Epic Games Store, this cozy first-person puzzle game invites players to step into the shoes of botanist Arabella Greene as she explores a Victorian manor to complete her botanical research. Unlike other puzzle games that can leave you feeling frustrated, Botany Manor strikes a balance between engaging challenges and a relaxing gameplay experience.

Lead developer Laure De May emphasizes that the game is designed to be peaceful and enjoyable, with puzzles that encourage exploration without overwhelming players. The games charm lies in its inviting atmosphere and the satisfaction of uncovering clues at your own pace. With positive reviews highlighting its appeal to casual gamers, Botany Manor stands out as a delightful option for those who appreciate a more laid-back approach to puzzle-solving.

As we see more games like Botany Manor that cater to casual gamers, it raises an interesting question: Could this shift in design philosophy redefine how we approach puzzle games in the future? Let's hope so!
