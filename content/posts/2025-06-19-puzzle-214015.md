NINES has just unveiled their upcoming puzzle game, Pipeworks Puzzle, and it promises to bring a refreshing twist to the classic tile sliding genre. Set in a charming construction site, players will step into the shoes of a plumber tasked with arranging disordered pipes to match a provided blueprint. With its cute visuals and relaxing soundtrack, this game is poised to captivate both casual gamers and puzzle enthusiasts alike.

What sets Pipeworks Puzzle apart is not just its engaging gameplay but also the inclusion of a support character named 'Boss', designed by the talented PokuriMio. This character will guide players from novice to master plumber, adding a layer of narrative and support that enhances the overall experience. The gameâ€™s grid-based arena allows for strategic movement in cardinal directions, making every decision count as players work to connect all the pipes.

Currently, players can wishlist Pipeworks Puzzle on Steam, which not only shows support for the developers but also unlocks exciting features like an endless mode, speedrun challenges, and multiplayer battles. A demo is on the horizon, so be sure to follow the game on Steam for updates. Are you ready to dive into the world of Pipeworks Puzzle and prove your plumbing prowess?
