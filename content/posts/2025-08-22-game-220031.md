This week, the Epic Games Store is treating gamers to two captivating titles for free: *Strange Horticulture* and *Kamaeru*. Available until August 28 at 8:30 PM IST, these games present unique experiences that cater to puzzle enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike. While *Strange Horticulture* immerses players in an occult-themed plant shop, *Kamaeru* invites users to embark on a whimsical frog-collecting journey.

*Strange Horticulture* stands out as an occult puzzle game where players manage a mysterious plant store in the town of Undermere. The gameplay revolves around identifying plants, solving interconnected puzzles, and unraveling occult mysteries. On the other hand, *Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective*, offered through Amazon Prime Gaming, challenges players to navigate mazes and solve puzzles to catch the elusive villain, Mr. X.

With the gaming landscape constantly evolving, these free offerings from Epic Games Store and Amazon Prime Gaming not only provide entertainment but also an opportunity for gamers to explore new genres. Will you take advantage of this week's free games and dive into these intriguing worlds?
