The Memphis Tigers made a powerful statement in their season opener, defeating Chattanooga 45-10, showcasing the potential of their new quarterback, Brendon Lewis. With a crowd of 25,011 fans at Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium, the atmosphere was electric, marking a fresh start for the team as they embark on a new season.

Interestingly, this game was the first time since 2020 that former quarterback Seth Henigan was not in uniform, now playing for the Jacksonville Jaguars. His absence highlights a significant transition for the Tigers, as they look to establish their identity with Lewis at the helm. The victory not only boosts team morale but also sets a promising tone for the rest of the season.

As the Tigers continue their journey, fans and analysts alike will be watching closely to see how Lewis develops and how the team adapts to their new dynamics. Will this be the year the Tigers make a serious run in their conference? Only time will tell.
