In a bold move that has caught the attention of the gaming community, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced its upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only highlights the long-standing desire for a Portal 3 but also sets high expectations for a game that aims to fill the shoes of one of the most beloved puzzle games ever created.

While the game draws comparisons to the iconic Portal series, particularly in its setting of a tech-testing environment, the gameplay mechanics seem to lean more towards the likes of **Qube** and **Qube 2**. Players will utilize a unique gun to manipulate colors and solve puzzles, which, while reminiscent of Portal's creativity, offers a fresh take on the genre. The original ChromaGun, released in 2016, garnered 'Mostly Positive' reviews, making fans eager to see how this sequel will innovate further.

For those intrigued, a free demo is available on Steam, allowing players to get a taste of the colorful puzzle-solving action. As we look forward to the release, one has to wonder: can ChromaGun 2 truly capture the magic of its predecessors while carving out its own identity in the puzzle gaming landscape?
