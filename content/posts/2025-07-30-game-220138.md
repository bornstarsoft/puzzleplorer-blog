Games Workshop has recently declared that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 has established a "new benchmark" for video games based on the iconic Warhammer franchise. With over 7 million copies sold, this title not only marks a significant commercial success but also reflects a shift in the company's strategy towards broader gaming platforms, particularly consoles.

For decades, Games Workshop primarily focused on niche PC games, but Space Marine 2 has showcased the potential of their IP to reach a wider audience. The game's success has prompted the company to actively explore further opportunities in the console and mobile gaming markets, signaling an exciting future for Warhammer fans.

As we look ahead, the promise of more content and the early development of Space Marine 3 raises the question: how will Games Workshop continue to innovate and expand its gaming universe? The future certainly looks bright for both the franchise and its dedicated community.
