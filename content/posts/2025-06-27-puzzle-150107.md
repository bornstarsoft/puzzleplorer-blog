Capcom's upcoming title, Pragmata, is set to redefine the gaming landscape with its innovative puzzle-shooting gameplay. Revealed in a recent gameplay video, players will engage in a unique experience where they must hack robots through a puzzle mini-game while simultaneously dodging and shooting at them. This dual-action mechanic promises to keep players on their toes, blending strategic thinking with fast-paced action.

Set in a near-future lunar research station in crisis, players will step into the shoes of Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, alongside his android companion, Diana. The game, which has been in development since its announcement in June 2020, showcases Capcom's commitment to delivering original IPs, diverging from its well-known franchises like Monster Hunter and Resident Evil. Despite facing multiple delays, the anticipation surrounding Pragmata continues to grow, especially after a recent media preview left players eager for more.

With its polished demo and intriguing mechanics, Pragmata appears poised to carve out a unique niche in the gaming world. As we await its official release in 2026, one can't help but wonder how Capcom will expand on these ideas over a potentially expansive gameplay experience. Will it live up to the high expectations set by its innovative premise?
