In a recent episode of the AnsweRED podcast, CD Projekt Red co-founder Marcin Iwiński shared a crucial insight: the studio's success hinges on its commitment to AAA open-world RPGs. Iwiński emphasized the importance of maintaining a sharp focus on what the company does best, rather than succumbing to the allure of diversifying into genres or features that may dilute their core strengths. This approach, he argues, is essential for delivering high-quality gaming experiences that fans expect.

Iwiński's reflections highlight a common challenge in the gaming industry—balancing innovation with expertise. As CD Projekt Red prepares for the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, the studio's leadership is keenly aware that spreading resources too thin can jeopardize the quality of their output. Joint-CEO Adam Badowski echoed this sentiment, reinforcing that their strategy remains firmly rooted in developing narrative-driven RPGs. This focus not only aligns with their identity but also ensures that they can invest the necessary time and effort into creating compelling gameplay.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it raises an interesting question: can other studios learn from CD Projekt Red's commitment to specialization? In a world where experimentation is often celebrated, perhaps the real key to long-term success lies in mastering a niche.
