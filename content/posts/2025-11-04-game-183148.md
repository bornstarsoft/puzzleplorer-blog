As we approach the end of 2025, Nintendo's Switch 2 is making headlines with its impressive lineup of games, particularly Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, both of which have been shortlisted for the prestigious 'Console Game of the Year' at the Golden Joystick Awards. This marks a significant milestone for Nintendo, showcasing the potential of their new system and its ability to compete with heavyweights like Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Ytei.

In addition to their nominations for 'Console Game of the Year', Mario Kart World is also in the running for 'Best Multiplayer Game', while Donkey Kong Bananza is vying for 'Best Audio Design'.
