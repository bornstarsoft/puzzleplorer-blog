A new Nintendo Direct is on the horizon, and it's dedicated to third-party games! Scheduled for February 5, this Partner Direct promises to unveil exciting titles for the Nintendo Switch and the newly launched Switch 2. With industry insiders like NatetheHate and GameXplain confirming the event, anticipation is building as gamers eagerly await announcements of major third-party titles.

As the Switch 2 continues to break sales records, with 4.4 million units sold in the US alone, players are hopeful for announcements that could further enhance their gaming experience. Confirmed titles for the Switch 2, such as Elden Ring and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, have already set the stage for an exciting year ahead.
