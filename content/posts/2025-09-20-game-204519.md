Microsoft has announced yet another price increase for its Xbox consoles in the US, just five months after the last hike. This latest adjustment, effective October 3, reflects the company's response to ongoing changes in the macroeconomic environment. The price of the Xbox Series X and S consoles will see significant increases, with the Series X now priced at $649.99 and the Series S models also experiencing notable hikes.

The updated pricing structure reveals that the Xbox Series S 512GB will now cost $399.99, up from $379.99, while the Series X Digital version will rise to $599.99. The most striking change is the Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Edition, which will now retail for $799.99 after a staggering $70 increase on top of its previous price. This places it above the PS5 Pro, which also offers 2TB of storage.

Interestingly, Microsoft has stated that prices for controllers and headsets will remain unchanged, and no adjustments will be made for consoles outside the US. As gamers navigate these new prices, one can't help but wonder: how will this impact the competitive landscape in the gaming industry moving forward?
